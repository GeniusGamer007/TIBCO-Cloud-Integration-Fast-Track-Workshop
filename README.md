## Workshop Overview
During this COVID crisis, a lot of storefronts are closed. Retailers are increasingly trying to manage sales through their websites to compensate. For a customer like myself, I would love to have an experience that is truly exceptional.  
So, how can a retailer change their established business process to provide an excellent customer experience and that too in a very short span of time?   
### What can the retailer can do ?  
They can 'automatically' waive the shipping fees for their loyal customers ! Helps customers save time (for contacting customer service via phone or chat) as well as, literally save money !

They have to
1) Identify the Customers who are loyal customers. 
*[CRM Lookup's, Reference Data ingestions,]*
