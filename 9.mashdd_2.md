# Configure the Package and Plan of the API Definition
Now click on Packages from the Design menu as shown below to look at the Package that was created and assigned for the API when it was published

Click on the ‘Actions’, option to review the details on the Package if needed. For this workshop, we can skip this part.

Click on ‘processOrderPackage to view the plans of the package that was created from the TCI Wizard.

Click on ‘processOrderPlan’ to apply more fine grained options.
*Note : This plan was created from the TCI wizard when we published the application*

Let’s look at the different options under ‘Plan’:

In the following step, under Plan Designer, we have the option to add multiple API Definitions and select the Endpoint Definitions.

This allows the same API Definition to be part of multiple plans as well as the same plan can have multiple API Definitions.
One reason for other plans to be created is to service the same API for different payment types.
For e.g. a ‘Gold Plan; can be created which has a lower throttle limit compared to the default plan that regular customers would use.
We can also Activate/Inactivate plans in a very simple way.

Self-Service Key Provisioning is enabled for the user to activate access

Rate Limits is an important option that defines how the API endpoint is throttled and quota limits are established.

Finally, enable access to ‘Everyone’ for this plan for our testing purposes.
