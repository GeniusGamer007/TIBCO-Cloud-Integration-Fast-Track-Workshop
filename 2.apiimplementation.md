# API Implementation and Reuse

TIBCO Cloud Integration allows an organization to implement an API Led development (following the Gartner Bi-Modal architecture principle) in very easy steps.  


## Creating an App (A Microservice)

So far we created the API Specification and tested it as a Mock App. Now we are ready to build the actual service based on the specification.

For this workshop, we will use 'Flogo', a lightweight integration tool available in TCI, to build a microservice from the API Spec.

There are many ways to navigate to Flogo -
1)	Start at Welcome to your TIBCO Cloud.
2)	Select Integration.
3)	Select Flogo.
 OR
If you are in the 'Mock Apps' page,
in order to return to the API Specifications Page click on API Specs as shown below:

### Flogo Application Initial Steps
From the main API Specs page, under the group you created, you should see your API specification. When you highlight your application you will see three vertical dots on the right, you can click on the dots to select “Create Flogo app”, as shown below .

For this workshop we will use the Default information provided. You can also rename your application, or keep the name that was automatically generated.
Finally click on “Create” to automatically generate a Flogo app for your API specification.

After waiting few seconds , As illustrated below, TCI automatically created a flow for the POST method you designed. We can now configure this flow, and add additional steps as required.
Click on the flow to edit it :

Notice that a trigger and an activity have been created for you:

### How to map fields and add activities in a Flogo App

**This is also referred to as 'Orchestrating and Transforming' the microservice flow**

We will now need to map the inputs to the outputs.  First click on the trigger and change the port number & save

We will map the following on Map to Flow Inputs: Note you can simply click on the elements or type them out as shown below and Save

Lastly we will map the following to Map to Flow Outputs. Note you can simply click on the elements or type them out as shown below and Save.

You can use a simple click and drag to move the activities within the flow, this will allow you to add new activities in order to build a complete end-to-end process. For this workshop we will be calling existing RESTful API to get a new transaction ID, extract customer and product information, log a message into the application log, and implement the response sent back to the user.

When we are finished the completed process orchestration will look similar to the one below.

## Creating a connection to CRM DB
Let's create a Connection which will be used to develop our integration app.

### Adding a FetchCustomerDetails Activity  

Now, let’s start configuring the process API to achieve an orchestration of services..

Click on the return activity, and drag it a few of places to the right as illustrated below :
<img src="/images/apiimp/10.png" alt="Create App" width=500/>

Note: Everything you do here is automatically saved.

Then click on the first orange box, find the "MySQL" options, and select the ‘MySQL Query’ activity.
Also rename that activity as FetchCustomerDetails by clicking on the pencil icon
