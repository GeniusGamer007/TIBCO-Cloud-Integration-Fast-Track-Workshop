# Publishing the API from your TCI Application
Now that we have created an application to process orders we can now expose this as an API with little effort. In other words, we will now push our Flogo App(The microservice that was created from the API Specification) to 'Mashery' which is the API Gateway Manager offering from TIBCO.

## Publishing the Flogo App into API Layer
Go to the Apps list and identify the app that is running, the endpoint of which needs to be published to the API Gateway ‘Mashery’.
From the Flogo App, traverse to the ‘Endpoints’ and click on the Publish to Mashery button as shown below:

Under the Traffic Manager Domain drop down select the *eval****** traffic manager that has been created for your trial and click Next:

**Note: It is important to choose the correct trial instance which is 'eval....' for this workshop**

Next click on New Definition.
Name it ‘shipmentWaiver’ and click Create:
This will create an API Definition for us.

Now Click on shipmentWaiverAPI definition that just got created:
![APIGATE](/images/apigate/4.png)

The ‘/shipmentwaiver’ operation is automatically selected (because this was the only operation we defined in the API Spec and which was subsequently implemented in the microservice).
Click Next:

API’s are provided through Packages which contain 1 or more plans.
We will now create both a package and a plan.
First let's create our package by clicking  ‘Create a package’ as shown below and name it “BasicPackage”

Next we will add a plan as shown. Name it as “StandardPlan”
Ensure the Allow self-provisioning keys box is checked and click Create:

Select the ‘StandardPlan’ and  Finally click Publish as shown below:

Once the API has been published a message similar to below will be shown:
