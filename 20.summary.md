#  Summary

We have now completed our workshop. Let us review what we did:
- Created an API Specification
- Create a Mock Application
- Created a Web Based Flogo App
- Tested the Application
- Published the APP to Mashery directly
- Worked with Mashery Control Center to Design the API endpoint
- Assigned Package and Plan to the API  
- Enabled Self Service on the Mashery  


We have barely scraped the surface of what is capable by leveraging the power of TIBCO Cloud Integration.

Where will your digital transformation take you?

The sky (or the cloud) is the limit.
