# What is Business App in TCI [update hthis]
We are going to import a low-code Business App. This app will add *an approval tracking flow* to be invoked by your process app. In other words, the microservice (built in Flogo) will be able to to reach out to a business process (built in LiveApps) to make it one seamless, 'ShipmentWaiverApp'

Low-Code business apps are created using another capability within TCI known as **'LiveApps' found inside 'Low Code Apps & Processes'**.

We will import this pre-built business app as part of the shipment waiver project.
