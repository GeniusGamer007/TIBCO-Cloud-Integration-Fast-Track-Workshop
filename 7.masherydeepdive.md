# Why do we need the TIBCO API Management - Mashery ?

These steps of directly pushing the application and the API Endpoint to an API Gateway like Mashery is with an intention of collating and exposing these services as Catalogs like how TIBCO has done for many other customers around the globe.

For example, here is a screenshot of Macy's API Catalog built using TIBCO Mashery.

## What is different about TIBCO Mashery ?

TIBCO Mashery scales at more than 2.6 BILLION calls per day servicing customers like Macy’s, NewsCorp Australia and many many more.

TIBCO Mashery platform offers customers the agility to switch between their cloud providers or use multiple cloud providers or choose a hybrid cloud architecture to better manage their egress charges as opposed to being tied to a particular cloud provider's API Gateway.

This flexibility and cost savings is of great advantage to many of our customers.

## Ways to bring the API endpoint into Mashery
There are multiple ways an API endpoint can be brought into Mashery.

1. By directly publishing from the cloud Integration with a single click as discussed in previous section
2. By Importing (a file or URI)
3. By creating manually

## Working with the Mashery Control Center
The next few steps on configuring the API Management revolve around how we set up the endpoint that was part of the application, to be properly secured and exposed over the Gateway.

Some of those steps are :
- Defining the API and configuring the endpoint(s)
- Applying Security layers
- Package related configurations on the API definition
- Plan(s) inside a package for the API Definition
- Creating documentation for user consumption

Mashery provides these options shown in the Dashboard below, to properly secure, define, configure and expose the endpoint of your application.

*Note: There is a timeout setting on TCI and if this section of Mashery times out and you are redirected to the login page, we suggest you login from TCI Main login page (cloud.tibco.com) and traverse to Mashery by clicking on the ‘Control Center’ option.*

OR
Click on API Definitions
