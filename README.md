## Workshop Overview
During this COVID crisis, a lot of storefronts are closed. Retailers are increasingly trying to compensate through online sales.
So, how can a retailer change their established business process to provide an excellent customer experience and that too in a very short span of time?   

### Can the retailer do 'something special' for a loyal customer?  
They can 'automatically' waive the shipping fees for their loyal customers !  
Helps customers save time and money *(no need to contact customer service via phone or chat)*
Retailer will also save on customer support esp. when their resources are spread pretty thin during this crisis time.

### How can this business requirement of enchancing the customer experience be achieved?
