# Configure the ‘Endpoints’ in API Definition for the Published Application

Click on the processOrderAPI to manage aspects of the API before exposing it.

The details about the endpoint and how to access it are displayed in the next step.

We will dive into the various options available to manage the API Definition itself as we go along.

However, let’s dive deeper into the endpoints available in our ‘processOrderAPI’ first. The ‘shipmentwaiver’ application that was configured in TCI has one endpoint as part of the ‘processOrderAPI’ definition.
Copy the public endpoint from your screen and paste it into a text file as we will be using this later.
Then click on the Edit option.

There are various action’s the administrator can perform on the API Definition *(in this case, the ‘shipmentwaiver’ app which is inside the ‘processOrderAPI’ definition)*, in the ‘Edit’ which includes: changing the Public Endpoint, Adding Security options etc..

Under ‘Domains & Traffic Routing’ you can change how the external URL can be modified.

We can change the Public Endpoint Address from the default view to a user readable format :

As an example, in Macy’s Catalog, the URL for the ‘Product Detail’ is user readable.

Under ‘Key & Method Detection’ you can validate and expand the various options available for interactions with the exposed method as well as choose the Authentication Type.
For this workshop, we will keep it as API Key .

In ‘More Settings’ you also have options, including ‘Allow calls having no API Key’

As an administrator of the API endpoint, you can define how the endpoint should be protected and exposed at a granular level.
With the configuration of the endpoint of the ‘shipmentwaiver’ application complete, let's go back to the ‘API Endpoints’
