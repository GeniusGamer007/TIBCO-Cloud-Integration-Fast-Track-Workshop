### Import Application and Adding a LowCode App

We are going to use a prebuilt application for this hands-on lab and extend it by adding a LowCode App (to change the process of waiver)



### Start Testing

In this section we will test **itineraries API** implementation.

1)	Select Start testing.
2)	Select Create a Launch Configuration.
3)	Expand Activity Input flowInputs->pathParams->reservationid.  And enter ‘AAAAA11111’ into flowInputs.  Use quotes.  Select Next. Select Run.
4)	Your Testing is complete.  Scroll down to see the response and confirm that aircraft details were added to the response.
5)	Select Stop Testing. Cancel.

### Push App

In this section we are going to push the itineraries app to the cloud and test the live endpoints.

1)	Select Push app.
2)	The itineraries app with be pushed to the cloud and you will see a progress bar and a completion message.
3)	Test your live endpoint by selecting Endpoint, select View and Test.
4)	Enter AAAAA11111 for reserverationid input parameter and select Try it out!

### Summary
In this exercise you imported an application and extended by reusing **aircrafts API**.  You performed a local test and pushed the application to the cloud.  You finshed by testing the application's live endpoints.

Next step: [Pushing the App](3.TCE.md)
