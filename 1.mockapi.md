# Creating a Mock  Application from the API Specification
Once the API Specification is created, we can create an application to implement it.
However, as an initial step, we will create a Mock Application!
Why ?

**Itâ€™s really a good idea to fake it before you make it.**

This step allows the developers and business analysts to further agree on the functionality of the intended API.
Architects and developers can get a head start on their work by leveraging the Mock API well before the implemented API goes into production; and can also provide feedback and changes earlier in the API development lifecycle. Supports continuous planning, development, and testing.

## Create the Mock App
In order to create our Mock Application we will simply click on the 3 bars to the right of the API Specification and select Create Mock Application as shown below:

Accept the defaults as shown below and click create:

## Test the Mock App
Once the application has been created and is running you can click on the endpoint and test it as shown below:

Scroll down to the sample payload and click try it out:

Notice the successful return code and sample data. Your Mock app is ready for testing by your developers:

## Summary
Creating Mock Apps is as simple as a mouse click on TIBCO Connected Intelligence Cloud.  In this section we leveraged the API that was created and generated and deployed a mock app to the cloud and tested the API end point.

In the next section we will implement the full back end microservice using a Web Based editor inside TCI to create an Application based on this agreed upon and mock tested API.
