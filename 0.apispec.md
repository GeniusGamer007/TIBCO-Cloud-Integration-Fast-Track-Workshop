# Collaborate on 'Special COVID Shipment Waiver' project  
**Why is this API Spec creation step important ?**  
Since this business initiative impacts Revenue and deals with Personal Customer Information, the project needs to be understood by all players within the Organization.

Expected output from this step is that Technical Team and Business Team agree on what inputs from the Customer Order page are needed to make the decision to waive the shipping fee and what response should be provided to the Customer.

These 'inputs' and 'outputs' will define the API Spec, which will then be used to create a microservice that will waive shipment fees. That microservice endpoint will then be exposed/linked to the customer order page via an API Gateway&Management Layer.   
This is called an **API Led Development approach**

## Let's start by Creating an API Spec which will define the inputs and outputs

### Getting to the API Spec section in TCI

Sign into TIBCO Cloud
![TCI Welcome Screen](/images/apispec/1.png)

Access the “APIs” tile from the main menu, and then select “API Modeling”.


### Create Group

Let’s create a GROUP to organize your APIs.

1)	Select the + sign next to GROUP.  
2)  Name your group **ShipmentWaiverProject** and press Create group.
3)  Select your **ShipmentWaiverProject** group.


### Import API Spec  

API Spec allows you to start from scratch or start with a existing specification that you can import from your file system, URL, or Github.  We are going to start with a existing API spec that will be imported from URL.

1)	Select the up-arrow next to **Create** to and choose Import from URL.
2)	Paste in and Import: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkarasz/keys2cloud2019/master/project/apispecs/ApiSpecs/v2/passengers.json`

### Explore API Spec

Now let’s explore the passenger API spec.  The purpose of this exploration is to showcase best practices as discussed in the above sections.

1)	Select passengers.
2)	Passengers API spec is opened to the /v2/passengers/{passengerid} resource and the GET method is highlighted and the request is shown.  The /v2/passengers/{passengerid} is the path developers will use to access this resource, the API is expecting a passengerid to be passed to it in the request.
3)	Select Response.  200 and 404 responses have been specified.  200 is the success response and 404 will be returned if no passenger is found for {passengerid}.
4)	Select Response 200/OK.  This shows an example of the 200 success response.  The passenger API spec is telling us that this API will respond with passenger details that include passengerid, name, street, city, and zip code.  Select Cancel.
5)	Explore some more.  Navigate to Resource /v2/passengers.  Resources for POST, GET, PUT and PATCH have been specified.

### Preview API

Previewing the API gives you a complete overview of the structure of your API along with input parameters, output responses and samples.  

1)	Select Preview.
2)	You are presented with interactive documentation showing all resources, parameters, methods and responses.  You can share this API specification with anyone in your organization and solicited feedback before you begin to implement.  This supports continuous planning and is a best practice development methodology.  


### Summary
API Specification on the TIBCO Connected Intelligence Cloud platform enables you to create blueprint structures for your APIs using a browser-based web GUI. Allows you to collaborate with others in your organizations to get early feedback and allow you to identify needed changes earlier in the API lifecycle.
