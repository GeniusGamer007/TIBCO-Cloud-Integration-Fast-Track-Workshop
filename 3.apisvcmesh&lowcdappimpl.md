# Service discovery using TIBCO Cloud Mesh

TIBCO Cloud Mesh allows an organization to connect to available services with a simple visual discovery including search and sort capabilities. In other words it simply enables you to present a REST service you have implemented, for others to use. {Think of reusability with a self-service option in an automated way :) }

For implementing the cloud mesh lets start by importing a ready-made flow.

## Importing an app for implementing via TIBCO cloud mesh

From you apps page click **"Create/Import"** Or **"APP_LIST.NEW_APP"** button > In dialog select flogo  > Create New App

<img src="/images/apisrvmshimp/1.png" alt="APISRVMSHIMP" width=850/>

In the next screen click "Import app" and then "browse to upload"

<img src="/images/apisrvmshimp/2.png" alt="APISRVMSHIMP" width=400/>  <img src="/images/apisrvmshimp/3.png" alt="APISRVMSHIMP" width=400/>

Select the file "createleadinMarketo" needed from your github downloaded project as shown below and click upload, followed by "Import all" in next dialog.

After few seconds the app will be successfully imported and is ready to be pushed(deployed) and consumed internally within organization.

## Deploying and publishing the app to cloud Mesh

Rename the flow and click "Push"to get it deployed.

After few seconds it will get deployed but will be in stopped state , and have to be scaled to 1 instance. Click on upward arrow and click scale and allow few seconds for it to be Running.

Once Running click "Apps" menu, find the app imported and click on "set endpoint visibility" .

In the next pop-up screen click "update" . This would allow the app to be discovered via cloud mesh as a reusable shared service.

 and That's easy it is for any service to be enabled for internally discoverable via mesh.  

 We are ready to discover and wire this service to our app.
**However, before we do that, let's also import a low-code business app**

Low-Code business apps are created using another capability within TCI known as **'LiveApps'**. We will import this pre-built business app as part of the shipment waiver project.

# Adding a Business App

 We are going to import a low-code Business App (to add an approval tracking flow available to be invoked by your process app) .  If you are doing the exercise by yourself ask the workshop team (jtamboli@tibco.com,akurian@tibco.com) to share the app on your Email for activation.

 Or

 You can build-it on your own [link to How-to build Page]

## Adding a Business Application

 **Make sure you are logged into cloud.tibco.com using the same Email ID you registered for the Trial Account**

We would need to start by activating the copy of the business app shared to you on email (The email will come from no-reply@tibco.com).

Click Activate

 <img src="/images/laactivate/1.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

Once activated, the app needs to complete a test before it can be published for wider use. Close the Prompt > Click on "Test Application" and Do not close the Prompt.

 <img src="/images/laactivate/2.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

 <img src="/images/poll.png" alt="poll" width=30 height=30 style="float:right"/>â€©

In order to test further , we have to create a case for the business app.  Click New

 <img src="/images/laactivate/3.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

Add values to shipping amount and click Submit.

 <img src="/images/laactivate/4.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>


A new case for the business app we have imported will be created . Close the Prompt and Open the case..

 <img src="/images/laactivate/5.png" alt="laactivate" width=400/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/images/laactivate/6.png" alt="laactivate" width=400/>

An Action has to be taken for this case , Click on "Waive" button to activate flow for this action .
 <img src="/images/laactivate/7.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

 Select the value as "Yes" and click Submit to complete the flow of this action and observe the End state for the case changes to Waived.

 <img src="/images/laactivate/8.png" alt="laactivate" width=400/>&nbsp;<img src="/images/laactivate/9.png" alt="laactivate" width=400/>

The testing is completed by now and we are ready to publish the Business App for connecting it via  "Flogo App".
and we will start by doing "Lock for Publication" action. Click on the arrow as shown below to exit the "Test Mode"

 <img src="/images/laactivate/10.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

 and, click "Lock for Publication"..

 <img src="/images/laactivate/12.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

The Business is now locked and ready to be published , Click the "administration" link from the success message..

 <img src="/images/laactivate/13.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

The business app is now ready for publication . click Publish ..

 <img src="/images/laactivate/14.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>

The business app is now published and ready to be consumed in the Flogo application.  observe the change of state.
 <img src="/images/laactivate/15.png" alt="laactivate" width=700/>


 Congratulations! You have now activated the Business app Application required to completed the Flogo app.

 We will now Import our Flogo process app and interact with LowCode App to complete rest of the lab.

 Next step: [Import the Microservice to connect with the Shipment Waiver process.   ](4.importingapp.md)

 **We are very close to successfully implementing the API Spec into a functioning microservice, inorder to satisfy the main business requirement of automatically waiving shipping fees**
