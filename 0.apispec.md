# Collaborate on 'Special COVID Shipment Waiver' project  
**Why is this API Spec creation step important ?**  
Since this business initiative impacts Revenue and deals with Personal Customer Information, the project needs to be understood by all players within the Organization.

Expected output from this step is that the Technical Team and Business Team agree on what inputs from the Customer Order page are needed to make the decision to waive the shipping fee and what response should be provided to the Customer.

These 'inputs' and 'outputs' will define the API Spec, which will then be used to create a microservice that will waive shipment fees. That microservice endpoint will then be exposed/linked to the customer order page via an API Gateway&Management Layer.   
This is called an **API Led Development approach**

## Let's start by Creating an API Spec which will define the inputs and outputs

### Getting to the API Spec section in TCI

Sign into TIBCO Cloud
![TCI Welcome Screen](/images/apispec/1_1.png)

Access the “APIs” tile from the main menu, and then select “API Model & Mock”.
![APISPEC](/images/apispec/2.png)

### Create Group
Let’s create a GROUP to organize your APIs.

1)	Select the + sign next to GROUPS.  
2)  Name your group **ShipmentWaiverProject** and press Create group.
3)  Select your **ShipmentWaiverProject** group.

Example :

<img src="/images/apispec/3.png" alt="APIIMP" width=300/>

### Creating an API Specification
Click on the group you created, and then click the “Create” button to create a new API specification to begin our development
<img src="/images/apispec/4.png" alt="APIIMP" width=500/>

For this workshop please create a new “Shipment Waiver” API specification. You can use version 1.0.0, and make sure to select your group as illustrated on the left-end side below :

<img src="/images/apispec/5.png" alt="APIIMP" width=500/>

OR, alternatively, you can skip these configuration steps and import the completed API spec from a file. Jump to the [Import the Completed API Spec](./0.apispec.md#consolidated-api-specs-needed-for-this-workshop) section below.

### Adding a Resource to the API
The next step is to add a resource to the API specification, and defining its associated methods.
To create a new resource, click on the “Add Resource” button on the left as illustrated below:
<img src="/images/apispec/6.png" alt="APIIMP" width=500/>

When creating a resource path we need to specify the resource path.
For example, enter “/shipmentWaiver”.
We must then select which method to implement from GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.  
 We will implement the POST method, please click on “POST”
<img src="/images/apispec/7.png" alt="APIIMP" width=500/>


## Configuring the API Resource’s POST Request  
As best practice for API development you should add a summary and a description (by clicking the “+Add” buttons in the header). This is optional for the workshop.

To configure the POST Request, make sure the “Request” button is highlighted as illustrated below.
<img src="/images/apispec/8.png" alt="APIIMP" width=500/>

To configure the request body parameters, please click on “+ Body parameter”:
<img src="/images/apispec/9.png" alt="APIIMP" width=500/>

Next we will generate a request schema from a sample request payload.

Click on Input Schema
<img src="/images/apispec/10.png" alt="APIIMP" width=400/>

Please click on "Generate Schema from Sample Data" and click  "Continue".

<img src="/images/apispec/11.png" alt="APIIMP" width=400/>

*On the next screen please copy paste this sample payload and click "Generate Schema"*

`{
  "customer" : {
  "loginid" : "jtamboli@tibco.com"
  },  
  "order" : {  
    "id" : "1",
    "shipping amount" : 10,
    "Total amount" : 20

  }

}`

<img src="/images/apispec/11_1.png" alt="APIIMP" width=800/>

Enter a name for InputSchema and click Save

<img src="/images/apispec/11_2.png" alt="APIIMP" width=800/>

## Configuring the Resource’s POST Response  
Next we will configure the POST method’s response to define from an API specification perspective what the user should be receiving as a response when invoking the POST operation of the  ‘processOrder’ resource.


First make sure you highlight the “Response” button:
![APISPEC](/images/apispec/12.png)

As you can see below TCI automatically created the 200/OK Success Response, and you can now specify the schema for the response.

Click on the pre-generated 200/OK response.
![APISPEC](/images/apispec/13.png)

Next click on “Generate Schema from Sample Data” (note that it can also be created manually) :
![APISPEC](/images/apispec/14.png)

You should get a message as illustrated below, simply select Continue :
![APISPEC](/images/apispec/15.png)

Enter the sample payload as shown from below, and click on Generate Schema.
![APISPEC](/images/apispec/16.png)

*If you don't want to type anything (like yours truly),:wink: please copy paste this*  

`{
"OrderSummary": {
"Message": “Shipment Waived Successfully”
“Order Number” : “318441”
}
}`  

As we did earlier for the request, make sure to name the generated schema for reusability (ex. ShipmentWaiverOutput) and save :
![APISPEC](/images/apispec/17.png)

## Consolidated API Specs needed for this workshop
### Import the Completed API Spec that defines this usecase.
1) Import as a 'filesystem' from the saved location as shown below :

![APISPEC](/images/apispec/17_1.png)

**Note: You should have already downloaded the git repository as a zip file locally in the beginning.**

The completely defined API Specification is named as 'shipmentwaiver-tci-wkshop.json'
![APISPEC](/images/apispec/18.png)
2) Select the up-arrow next to **Create**.
3) It will get imported successfully and will show-up into your api-spec list.

### Summary
API Specification on the TIBCO Connected Intelligence Cloud platform enables you to create blueprint structures for your APIs using a browser-based web GUI. Allows you to collaborate with others in your organizations to get early feedback and allow you to identify needed changes earlier in the API lifecycle.
