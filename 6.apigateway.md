# Creating an API endpoint from your Application

Now that we have created an application we can now expose this as an API with just a couple of clicks.
In other words, we will now push our Flogo App(The microservice that was created from the API Specification) to 'Mashery' which is the API Gateway Manager offering from TIBCO.

## Pushing Flogo App as an API
From the Flogo App that was created, click on the Publish to Mashery button as shown below:

Go to the Apps list and identify the app that is running, the endpoint of which needs to be published to the API Gateway ‘Mashery’.
